#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?
print(f"the print frunction")
#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?
print(f" it would be input")
#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 

#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?
print(f"when you incounter a syntax error it mean you aren't speaking the computers language")
#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.
print(f"a stroage container")
#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.
name=("Sa'id")
print(f"hi my name is {name}")
#7. What is a function definition and a function call?

#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal
# == // double equal
# != // exclaimation equal
print(f"single means its a normal math equation 2 equales wich one is true or false like if there bot equale to and a exclamation mark means its not equal too ")
#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

#print(var1 + var2 + var3)

print(f'it would be a type error because var3 is a string so you would have to put' +str(var3))
#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)
print(f" they would say true because it has 2 equal signs which means it's gonna determine if the 2 list are even or not")
# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.
listone= ["pencils, paper, notebook,"]
listtwo= [12.50, 50.00, 15.00]
print(listone != listtwo)
# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?

# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?
print(f"say get in this place everything that u give the worker there would have to match with what they got on thier data base")
# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?
print(f'say u and your friends have to get something to eat and ya need to buy something from the store so ya''ll combine yall money so ya can get the pizza')
# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300
print(currentScore==highScore)
# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
print(f"The type() function returns the type of the specified object")
